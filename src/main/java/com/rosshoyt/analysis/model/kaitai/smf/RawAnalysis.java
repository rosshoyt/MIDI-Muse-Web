/**
 * Standard MIDI file, typically knows just as "MID", is a standard way
 * to serialize series of MIDI events, which is a protocol used in many
 * music synthesizers to transfer music data: notes being played,
 * effects being applied, etc.
 *
 * Internally, file consists of a header and series of tracks, every
 * track listing MIDI events with certain header designating time these
 * events are happening.
 *
 * NOTE: Rarely, MIDI files employ certain stateful compression scheme
 * to avoid storing certain elements of further elements, instead
 * reusing them from events which happened earlier in the
 * stream. Kaitai Struct (as of v0.9) is currently unable to parse
 * these, but files employing this mechanism are relatively rare.
